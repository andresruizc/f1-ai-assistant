# Data Directory

This folder holds all runtime data for the F1 AI Race Engineer. Nothing here is committed to git (except this README and `.gitkeep`).

## Structure

```

## How it works

**FastF1** manages all data downloading and caching automatically:

1. When you call `session.load()` for the first time, FastF1 downloads raw timing data from the F1 API and saves it as `.ff1pkl` (pickle) files inside `.fastf1_cache/`.
2. Subsequent loads for the same session read from the local cache — no network needed.
3. The cache is **per-machine** and typically **100–150 MB per race** (all sessions: race, qualifying, practice).

## Key points

- **Cache path** is configured in `config/settings.yaml` under `fastf1.cache_dir`.
- **Gitignored**: The entire `.fastf1_cache/` directory is in `.gitignore`. Each developer downloads their own copy.
- **Docker**: In Docker Compose, the cache is stored in a named volume (`fastf1_cache`) so it persists across container restarts.
- **Downloading all races**: Run `uv run f1-data-loader` to pre-download all 2025 race sessions. First run takes ~5-10 minutes for the full season; subsequent runs are instant from cache.

## What NOT to put here

- No manually created data files — everything is auto-generated by FastF1.
- No credentials or API keys.
- If we add processed/exported data later, it goes in a clearly named subfolder (e.g. `data/exports/`) and is also gitignored.
